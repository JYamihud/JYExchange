1.3

New scripting system.

As you maybe saw there is a console in the bottom of the
JYExchange window. This console now has more functionality.

More info you can get by typing HELP in it and pressing enter.

You can controll all kinds of setting with those commands
and there will be more commands in future.

All of them can be executed via a file such as .sh in bash.
You can make one in any text editor by writting down each
command in a new line and saving to .jyes format
(simply save the file as text (.txt) and rename the ending
(.txt) to (.jyes).

To load them into the jyexchange you will have to use terminal
such as:

python jyexchange.py /home/yourname/yourfolder/thescriptyouwrote.jyes

and JYExchange will run the script on the startup.

[THIS FEATURE IS DEVELOPED TO HELP TO BLENDER ORGINIZER NEW SET OF FEATURES]

1: There is a fixed Broadcasted menu. If the other side renames or closes the connection. 
It will disappear or change on the screen rather then adding a new connection like in the
last version.

2: There was a bug with the updater that was trying to check for updates during any connection
not even checking if the accsess to the actuall internet is available. I tried to run it on a
local only network using a local router to connect 2 computers but not connect to the internet.
  
It was stopping the software from opening so I made the checking for the Update optional by
pressing the GitHub update button.

BUG FIXED! Unsinc while merging
                     
There was a mistake in the new feature of merging folder. This
feature is temporarely substituting an automatic analogous. It's
checking if the file (from the folder) already exists... And if yes
checks if the size is the same as on the Server. If it's both exist
and the size is the same... It's Skippes the file. If not downloads
the new version from server. This is now done automatically.
WARNING ! REQUAIERS UPDATE ON BOTH SIDES.
    
FOLDERS PROGRESS DOUBLE WIDGET
                     
Now you can see both progress of current file and the whole folder
at the progress widget on the top in the same time. There been done a
clever way to do so... I hope you'll like it.

BUG FIXED! 0 bite files:
                
The was a problem with files less then 1 bite in size.
The sender tried to send the first couple bites from it...
But since there is no bites to send it was crashing and getting
into a weird never ending loop.

It wasn't a bad in 0.3 because there were no dependicies
on file actually finishing donloading to continue the loop.
Let's say you have many files in the folder and one of them is
0 bites... It's a big deal if this 0 bite file never finishes
downloading because there are more file to go after him


FOLDERS MERGE FUNCTIONS:

Now you can downlod folders partially... Select the files
manually. Or use quick select functions. Such as Add Missing,
add changed in size Bigger Size or Smaller Size.

0.41
Shows each uploading file in folders:

Now if you are the server and from your machine the folder 
been downloaded. Means that you are the uploader. You will see in 
the console each uploading file.
This will help you know what file exactly did client get...

__________________________________________________________________________ 

0.4
Download lists:

Now you finally can download a bunch of files in one click.
there is a new uncloked feature (it was locked because the button
didn't do anything before now). Just click donwload not on the file
it self. But on the download on the top panel. And you will get
all the list donwloaded... Cool isn't that?


Faster folders:

In the previous version of JYExchange you had a slow folders transfer
due to the fact that it was zipping and unzipping folders for no reason.
Now in version 0.4 the folders are not zipped, but transferred with a
info file. It will make an improvement of speed drastically.

(NOTE: There will be a support for the old way if the server or client on
other side is older. But recomended to make at least a local update to 0.4
for quicker folder transfer)

0.3

True updater:

Before this you would update from the version on the second end.
which is rediculas... Now you can do that through the github.
If new version published... The programm will notify you about the update.
