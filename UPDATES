0.3

Faster folders:

In the previous version of JYExchange you had a slow folders transfer
due to the fact the it was zipping and unzipping folders for no reason.
Now in version 0.3 the folders are not zipped, but transferred with a
info file. It will make an improvement of speed drastically.
(NOTE: old version of folders sending will not be supported
so update the JYExchange on both ends of the connection)

True updater:

Before this you would update from the version on the second end.
which is rediculas... Now you can do that through the github.
If new version published... The programm will notify you about the update.
