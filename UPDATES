0.4
                            Download lists:
    Now you finally can download a bunch of files in one click.
there is a new uncloked feature (it was locked because the button
didn't do anything before now). Just click donwload not on the file
it self. But on the download on the top panel. And you will get
all the list donwloaded... Cool isn't that?


                            Faster folders:

     In the previous version of JYExchange you had a slow folders transfer
due to the fact that it was zipping and unzipping folders for no reason.
Now in version 0.4 the folders are not zipped, but transferred with a
info file. It will make an improvement of speed drastically.

(NOTE: There will be a support for the old way if the server or client on
other side is older. But recomended to make at least a local update to 0.4
for quicker folder transfer)
