1: There is a fixed Broadcasted menu. If the other side renames or closes the connection. 
It will disappear or change on the screen rather then adding a new connection like in the
last version.

2: There was a bug with the updater that was trying to check for updates during any connection
not even checking if the accsess to the actuall internet is available. I tried to run it on a
local only network using a local router to connect 2 computers but not connect to the internet.
  
It was stopping the software from opening so I made the checking for the Update optional by
pressing the GitHub update button.
