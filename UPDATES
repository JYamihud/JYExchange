New scripting system.

As you maybe saw there is a console in the bottom of the
JYExchange window. This console now has more functionality.

More info you can get by typing HELP in it and pressing enter.

You can controll all kinds of setting with those commands
and there will be more commands in future.

All of them can be executed via a file such as .sh in bash.
You can make one in any text editor by writting down each
command in a new line and saving to .jyes format
(simply save the file as text (.txt) and rename the ending
(.txt) to (.jyes).

To load them into the jyexchange you will have to use terminal
such as:

python jyexchange.py /home/yourname/yourfolder/thescriptyouwrote.jyes

and JYExchange will run the script on the startup.
